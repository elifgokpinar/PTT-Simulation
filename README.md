# 🏣 PTT-Simulation
<h2>Description of Model Topic</h2>

Nowadays, waiting in line is a big problem for customers. With the increasing in the population, organizations may be insufficient in this regard. Customer satisfaction is very important for organizations. If the customer is satisfied with the service, the customer continues to prefer that company. 

The biggest problem for customers is waiting in the queue. Because they want to get things done and leave without wasting time. If there are long queues at a company with no specified method, the customer begins to complain. Companies try to find solutions to prevent them. One of these companies is postal organizations is PTT (T.C. Posta ve Telgraf Teşkilatı Genel Müdürlüğü) can be an example for this. There are many transactions such as money transfer, cargo sending, receiving cargo in PTT.

In order to provide better services, the queue problem will be tried to be solved in this project.

<h3>📄 Details</h3>
<p>There are two simulation model.</p>
<p><b>First simulation model</b> = There are only 2 tellers.</p>
<p><b>Second simulation model</b> = We added ATM. Because machines can run faster than humans. Customers who come for some money transactions can do their job at the ATM in our second model.</p>

<p>We observed average waiting time in queue, average service time, average waiting time in system, total customer entered to system, total customer entered to service, total customer which completed service, simulation time of both models.</p>

<p>We calculated the confidence interval and prediction interval of these values. Finally, we compared the results of the 2 models.</p>

<h3>📊 Results of Model 2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Average waiting time in queue was decreased.</li>
  <li>Average spent time in system was decreased.</li>
  <li>AVG service time was decreased.</li>
  <li>Completed jobs were increased.</li>
  <li>Number of customers were increased.</li>
</ul>
